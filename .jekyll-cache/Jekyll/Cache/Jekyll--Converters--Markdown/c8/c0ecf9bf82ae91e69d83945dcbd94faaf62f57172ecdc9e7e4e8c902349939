<h1 id="about">About</h1>

<p>I am a cryptocurrency hobbyist. I actually acknowledged Bitcoin/crypto since 2011 and have some of it stored on exchange. Then I forgot it like most of people done, because BTC was so cheap back then. Until BTC massive pump happened on 2017, I remembered, ‚ÄúAh, I have some coins on exchange xxx‚Äù. I went to check it out, but BAM!, the exchange has disappeared.</p>

<p>That was stupid of me back then that I left my assets on exchange. I didn‚Äôt understand that I could save my crypto assets (private key) on paper or offline storage, I thought it must be online 24/7 !!!</p>

<p>But, I would still love crypto. There were many projects popped out on 2017. Although most of them were shitcoins, ponzi schemes or blatantly scams. My interest was on mining new coins. Most of them were POW coins. New forked coins appeared everyday. But yeah, mostly are dead projects now. We can see now that consensus protocol interest are shifting to POS. So I try to get experience of it by participating on many projects by being validator.</p>

<p>I have no/little programming skill. So why do I choose to participate in this crypto space that required some of technical skills?</p>

<p>First, I believe with spirit of decentralization, mass adoption will come true, one of the way to go there is by making ‚Äúnormal people‚Äù like me to participate in. I make assumption that if I can open and back up wallet, mining coin, being validator, delegating, etc, other ‚Äúnormal people‚Äù also can do it.</p>

<p>Second, I find inspiration in independent validators like <a href="https://meleatrust.com/">meleatrust</a> also <a href="https://moonli.me/">moonli.me</a> and believe that <strong><em>‚Äúsmaller validators should have more power and wider participation in POS systems‚Äù (moonli.me).</em></strong> :wink:</p>

<p>Third, profit, knowledge and experience gain, no need to explain :grin:</p>
